Hi all,

For those of you who wish to connect to deepblue via WinSCP from home.  
There is a preliminary step which requires a VPN connection.

Here's how to set it up.

If you set your browser to point to:

https://tec259.camosun.ca

... you will be prompted with a login.  (important to note the use of https and not just http)


Enter your Camosun # (C#######) and your password.



In the left sidebar, click on AnyConnect, and then in the main page - click on "Start AnyConnect".



This should start an assessment of your system and set you up with 
a client configured for your machine so that you can VPN in.  

Give it a moment, and it should eventually provide you with a link 
"Windows Desktop" (assuming you are using Windows) which you can click on to download and save an exe file.





If you install this file, and then run it - you should be able to tell the client to connect to the following address:

tec259.camosun.ca





Give that a try and see if you can connect.





If you can - next try to access deepblue as you normally would from within one of the labs on campus (via WinSCP).



That should be everything!
