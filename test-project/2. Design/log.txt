/*CHANGED:
 *ALTER TABLE SOLD_PRODUCT MODIFY quantity INT(255);
 *ALTER TABLE SOLD_PRODUCT MODIFY review VARCHAR(6553);
 *ADD 3 more customers in customer table (cust_id 6, 7, 8)
 *Password = Username
 *Insert 90 rows in ORDERINFO table
 *Insert 90 rows in SOLD_PRODUCT table
 *Just make sure all products had at least one rate and review
 *Therefore I set all order_id = product_id in SOLD_PRODUCT table
 *ALSO in CODE table, 03 means delivered in ORDER_STATUS column
 *A dish should delivered first then a customer can write a reavle
 *Therefore I set all ORDER_STATUS to 03 in ORDERINFO table 
 *Always make sure there is a ORDER_ID in ORDERINFO table first (A customer placed a order) 
 *then can have a row insert into SOLD_PRODUCT table (A customer received a order)
