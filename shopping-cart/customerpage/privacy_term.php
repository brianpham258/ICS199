Thank you for using ThinkFood! We are committed to providing you the best online delivery experience possible. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how that information is used, under what circumstances we share information, and the choices you can make about that information. This Privacy Policy applies whether you access the ThinkFood Services through a browser, a mobile application, or any other method.
Information we collect

1. INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US OR ALLOW OTHERS TO PROVIDE TO US

At various points in the ThinkFood experience, you may provide us with information about yourself. For example, when you create an account through the Services, you provide us with personal information like your name, email address, and postal code. If you request a delivery or otherwise use the Services, we collect information including your address, phone number, birth date (when required), credit card information, and the details of your order. Your account information may be updated or corrected by accessing your account settings.

If you log into the Services through a third-party service, both we and that third-party may receive some information about you and your use of the services. For example, if you choose to log into the Services with your Facebook account, we may receive information from Facebook, such as your name, e-mail address, public profile information, and information about your contacts. We may also offer social sharing tools (such as the Facebook “Like” button) that let you share actions on the Services with other websites and vice versa. In those cases, the providers of those tools may receive information about you when you use those tools. You should check the privacy policies of these third party services and your settings there for more information.

Our partners may let us collect information about use of their sites/apps or share such information with us. For example, if you use an ThinkFood button or widget on another site or app, we may receive information about your use of that button or widget and the third-party site/app.


2. TECHNICAL INFORMATION ABOUT USAGE OF THE SERVICES

When you use the Services, either through a browser or mobile app, we automatically receive some technical information about the hardware and software that is being used.
Cookies, Pixels, and Other Tracking Technologies: We, our partners, our advertisers, and third party advertising networks use various technologies to collect information, including but not limited to cookies, pixels, scripts, and device identifiers. Cookies are small text files that are sent by your computer when you access our services through a browser. We, our partners, our advertisers, and third party advertising networks may use session cookies (which expire when you close your browser), persistent cookies (which expire when you choose to clear them from your browser), pixels, scripts, and other identifiers to collect information from your browser or device that helps us do things such as understand how you use our services and other services; personalize your experience; measure, manage, and display advertising on the Services or on other services; understand your usage of the Services and other services in order to serve customized ads and remember that you are logged into the Services. By using your browser settings, you may block cookies or adjust settings for notifications when a cookie is set.
We employ some third-party services to help us understand the usage of the Services and the performance of advertising, and these third-parties may also deploy cookies, pixels, or other identifiers on the Services or collect information through our mobile applications. For example, we use Google Analytics to understand, in a non-personal way, how users interact with various portions of the Services -- you can learn more about information that Google may collect by searching their privacy policy.
